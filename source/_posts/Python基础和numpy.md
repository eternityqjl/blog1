## Basic of Python

### Basic data types

#### Numbers

#### Bolleans

#### Strings

### Containers

#### Lists

#### Slicing

#### Loops

<!--more-->

#### Dictionaries

key-value

#### Sets

unordered

#### Tuples

A tuple is in many ways similar to a list; one of the most important differences is that tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries and as elements of sets, while lists cannot.

### Functions

`def` keyword

### Classes

```python
class Greeter:

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Create an instance variable

    # Instance method
    def greet(self, loud=False):
        if loud:
          print('HELLO, {}'.format(self.name.upper()))
        else:
          print('Hello, {}!'.format(self.name))

g = Greeter('Fred')  # Construct an instance of the Greeter class
g.greet()            # Call an instance method; prints "Hello, Fred"
g.greet(loud=True)   # Call an instance method; prints "HELLO, FRED!"
```

## Numpy

Numpy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.

### Arrays

A numpy array is **a grid of values**, all of the **same type**, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers. The number of dimensions is the rank of the array; the shape of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.

### Array indexing

#### Slicing

example

```python
import numpy as np

# Create the following rank 2 array with shape (3, 4)
# [[ 1  2  3  4]
#  [ 5  6  7  8]
#  [ 9 10 11 12]]
a = np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12]])

# Use slicing to pull out the subarray consisting of the first 2 rows
# and columns 1 and 2; b is the following array of shape (2, 2):
# [[2 3]
#  [6 7]]
b = a[:2, 1:3]
print(b)
```

Two ways of accessing the data in the middle row of the array. Mixing integer indexing with slices yields an array of lower rank, while using only slices yields an array of the same rank as the original array:

```python
row_r1 = a[1, :]    # Rank 1 view of the second row of a  
row_r2 = a[1:2, :]  # Rank 2 view of the second row of a
row_r3 = a[[1], :]  # Rank 2 view of the second row of a
print(row_r1, row_r1.shape)
print(row_r2, row_r2.shape)
print(row_r3, row_r3.shape)
```

#### Integer array indexing

Integer array indexing allows you to construct arbitrary arrays using the data from another array.

```python
a = np.array([[1,2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])

# An example of integer array indexing.
# The returned array will have shape (3,) and 
print(a[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]])

# The above example of integer array indexing is equivalent to this:
print(np.array([a[0, 0], a[1, 1], a[2, 0]]))
```

result:

[1 4 5]

```python
# When using integer array indexing, you can reuse the same
# element from the source array:
print(a[[0, 0], [1, 1]])

# Equivalent to the previous integer array indexing example
print(np.array([a[0, 1], a[0, 1]]))
```

One useful trick with integer array indexing is selecting or mutating one element from each row of a matrix:

```python
# Create a new array from which we will select elements
a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [10, 11, 12]])
print(a)
```

```python
# Create an array of indices
b = np.array([0, 2, 0, 1])

# Select one element from each row of a using the indices in b
print(a[np.arange(4), b])  # Prints "[ 1  6  7 11]"
```

[1 6 7 11]

#### Boolean array indexing

Frequently this type of indexing is used to select the elements of an array that **satisfy some condition**.

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([[1,2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])

bool_idx = (a > 2)  # Find the elements of a that are bigger than 2;
                    # this returns a numpy array of Booleans of the same
                    # shape as a, where each slot of bool_idx tells
                    # whether that element of a is > 2.

print(bool_idx)
```

[[False False]
 [ True  True]
 [ True  True]]

```python
# We use boolean array indexing to construct a rank 1 array
# consisting of the elements of a corresponding to the True values
# of bool_idx
print(a[bool_idx])

# We can do all of the above in a single concise statement:
print(a[a > 2])
```

[3 4 5 6]
[3 4 5 6]

### Datatypes

Every numpy array is a grid of elements of the same type. Numpy provides a large set of numeric datatypes that you can use to construct arrays. Numpy tries to guess a datatype when you create an array, but functions that construct arrays usually also include an optional argument to explicitly specify the datatype. Here is an example:

```python
x = np.array([1, 2])  # Let numpy choose the datatype
y = np.array([1.0, 2.0])  # Let numpy choose the datatype
z = np.array([1, 2], dtype=np.int64)  # Force a particular datatype

print(x.dtype, y.dtype, z.dtype)
```

### Array math

Note that unlike MATLAB, `*` is elementwise multiplication, not matrix multiplication. We instead use the dot function to compute inner products of vectors, to multiply a vector by a matrix, and to multiply matrices. dot is available both as a function in the numpy module and as an instance method of array objects:

```python
x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]], dtype=np.float64)
y = np.array([[5,6],[7,8]], dtype=np.float64)

# Elementwise product; both produce the array
print(x * y)
print(np.multiply(x, y))
```

[[ 5. 12.]
 [21. 32.]]
[[ 5. 12.]
 [21. 32.]]

```python
x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
y = np.array([[5,6],[7,8]])

v = np.array([9,10])
w = np.array([11, 12])

# Inner product of vectors; both produce 219
print(v.dot(w))
print(np.dot(v, w))
```

219
219

You can also use the `@` operator which is equivalent to numpy's `dot` operator.

to transpose a matrix, simply use the T attribute of an array object:

```python
print("transpose\n", x.T)
```

transpose
 [[1 3]
 [2 4]]

### Broadcasting

Broadcasting is a powerful mechanism that allows numpy to work with arrays of different shapes when performing arithmetic operations.

For example, suppose that we want to add a constant vector to each row of a matrix. We could do it like this:

```python
# We will add the vector v to each row of the matrix x,
# storing the result in the matrix y
x = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [10, 11, 12]])
v = np.array([1, 0, 1])
y = np.empty_like(x)   # Create an empty matrix with the same shape as x

# Add the vector v to each row of the matrix x with an explicit loop
for i in range(4):
    y[i, :] = x[i, :] + v

print(y)
```

[[ 2  2  4]
 [ 5  5  7]
 [ 8  8 10]
 [11 11 13]]

Numpy broadcasting allows us to perform this computation without actually creating multiple copies of v. Consider this version, using broadcasting:

```python
import numpy as np

# We will add the vector v to each row of the matrix x,
# storing the result in the matrix y
x = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [10, 11, 12]])
v = np.array([1, 0, 1])
y = x + v  # Add v to each row of x using broadcasting
print(y)
```

The line `y = x + v` works even though `x` has shape `(4, 3)` and `v` has shape `(3,)` due to broadcasting; this line works as if v actually had shape `(4, 3)`, where each row was a copy of `v`, and the sum was performed elementwise.

## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a plotting library. In this section give a brief introduction to the `matplotlib.pyplot` module, which provides a plotting system similar to that of MATLAB.

### Plotting

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
# Compute the x and y coordinates for points on a sine curve
x = np.arange(0, 3 * np.pi, 0.1)
y = np.sin(x)

# Plot the points using matplotlib
plt.plot(x, y)
```

### Subplots

```python
# Compute the x and y coordinates for points on sine and cosine curves
x = np.arange(0, 3 * np.pi, 0.1)
y_sin = np.sin(x)
y_cos = np.cos(x)

# Set up a subplot grid that has height 2 and width 1,
# and set the first such subplot as active.
plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)

# Make the first plot
plt.plot(x, y_sin)
plt.title('Sine')

# Set the second subplot as active, and make the second plot.
plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.plot(x, y_cos)
plt.title('Cosine')

# Show the figure.
plt.show()
```
